Simple spatial regression project that explores functionalities of R packages like sp, spdep, geosphere, spatialreg or coda. 

The aim was to explore spatial correlations of tourism between different departments of France. The results unfortunately were not particularly interesting.

Actual code in file spatial_regression_project. Remaining files are necessary datasets.

Comments are in Polish.
